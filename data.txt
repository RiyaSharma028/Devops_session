Morning light slipped through the cracks in the curtains, painting soft patterns on the floor.  
A forgotten notebook lay open on the desk, its pages filled with half-written ideas and crossed-out thoughts.  
Outside, the city slowly woke up, one sound at a time—footsteps, distant horns, and murmured conversations.  

The clock on the wall ticked steadily, indifferent to human worries and deadlines.  
A cup of coffee cooled beside the keyboard, steam fading into nothingness.  
Somewhere in the building, a door creaked open and shut, followed by quiet laughter.  

Random memories surfaced without warning, triggered by nothing in particular.  
A song played faintly from a neighboring room, its melody familiar but the lyrics forgotten.  
Dust particles floated lazily in the air, illuminated for a brief moment before disappearing again.  

As the day moved forward, plans changed, messages were sent, and promises were delayed.  
Yet, between all the motion, there were small pauses—moments where everything felt still.  
Those moments passed quickly, unnoticed, like lines in a text file never read again.
