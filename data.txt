Morning light slipped through the cracks in the curtains, painting soft patterns on the floor.  
A forgotten notebook lay open on the desk, its pages filled with half-written ideas and crossed-out thoughts.  
Outside, the city slowly woke up, one sound at a time—footsteps, distant horns, and murmured conversations.  

The clock on the wall ticked steadily, indifferent to human worries and deadlines.  
A cup of coffee cooled beside the keyboard, steam fading into nothingness.  
Somewhere in the building, a door creaked open and shut, followed by quiet laughter.  

Random memories surfaced without warning, triggered by nothing in particular.  
A song played faintly from a neighboring room, its melody familiar but the lyrics forgotten.  
Dust particles floated lazily in the air, illuminated for a brief moment before disappearing again.
